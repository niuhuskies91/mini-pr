<!-- | This is the configuration file for Maven. It can be specified at two
    levels: | | 1. User Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration
    for a single user, | and is normally provided in ${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml.
    | | NOTE: This location can be overridden with the CLI option: | | -s /path/to/user/settings.xml
    | | 2. Global Level. This settings.xml file provides configuration for all
    Maven | users on a machine (assuming they're all using the same Maven | installation).
    It's normally provided in | ${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml. | | NOTE: This
    location can be overridden with the CLI option: | | -gs /path/to/global/settings.xml
    | | The sections in this sample file are intended to give you a running start
    at | getting the most out of your Maven installation. Where appropriate,
